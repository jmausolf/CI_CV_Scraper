# CI Directory Cleaner

## This module contains the code used to manipulate and clean data from the University of Chicago's Whitelist Directory. 

## The initial file was a 397-page PDF of individuals with titles and contact information. Conversion of this file to a text file resulted in a text document of over 100,000 rows.  

## This was then cleaned using this module.
